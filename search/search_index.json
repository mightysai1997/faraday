For more information about PostgreSQL Backup follow this link","title":"Database restore"},{"location":"Basic-plugin-development/","text":"In this guide we are going to learn how to develop a new plugin for Faraday. Configure Custom Plugins \u00b6 To add custom plugins in faraday, you first need to run this command: faraday-manage settings -a update reports Create Plugin structure \u00b6 Create the folder new_plugin inside the custom_plugins folder and add the following files inside the new_plugin folder: Plugin Structure: new_plugin/ __init__.py # leave this file empty plugin.py Warning Please respect both file names: __init__.py and plugin.py Plugin code \u00b6 There are two types of plugins: File plugins (plugins that process the contents of a file) Command plugins (plugins that process the execution of a command) A faraday plugin can be either or both of these types. For example the ping plugin only process the execution of the command, but the nmap command supports both the xml generated by nmap or process the execution of nmap. In your plugin.py file you must provide a function called createPlugin for the plugin manager to instantiate the plugin def createPlugin(ignore_info=False, hostname_resolution=True): return YourPluginClass(ignore_info=ignore_info) Plugin classes \u00b6 PluginBase is the base class. For File plugins we provide all this classes. But you can add other by creating a subclass of PluginByExtension PluginBase PluginByExtension PluginXMLFormat PluginJsonFormat PluginMultiLineJsonFormat PluginCSVFormat PluginZipFormat For Command plugins only you must inherit from PluginBase Your plugin class __init__ method must define the id , that will be the identifier of your plugin. Here's an example of the Ping tool plugin: class CmdPingPlugin ( PluginBase ): def __init__ ( self , * arg , ** kwargs ): super () . __init__ ( * arg , ** kwargs ) self . id = \"ping\" self . name = \"Ping\" self . plugin_version = \"0.0.1\" self . version = \"1.0.0\" self . _command_regex = re . compile ( r '^(sudo ping|ping|sudo ping6|ping6)\\s+.*?' ) Beware that it must be unique, you can list all the plugins identifiers with this command: faraday-plugins list-plugins File Plugins \u00b6 Each of the subclasses for File plugins provide a different way for the plugin to detect if it can process the file PluginByExtension: \u00b6 This class adds the functionality for identify a file by its extension by setting the attribute extension . It can be one extension ( \".xml\" ) or a list ( ['.xml', '.xxx'] ) if your file can have multiple extensions. You never inherit directly from this class in a plugin but from some of its subclasses that are more specific. class ExampleXMLTool(PluginByExtension): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.extension = \".xml\" PluginXMLFormat: \u00b6 Use this class if the plugin generates vulnerabilities from a xml file. If your report has xml format but a different extension (like nessus), remember to define the extension attribute To identify the file set in the identifier_tag attribute the main tag of the xml (ScanGroup in the example), it also can be one tag or a list of tags. You can also set the identifier_tag_attributes attribute, it is a set of attributes that the main tag must have. This is used to be more specific for example if the main tag is too generic and the xml of other plugin has the same one. Example XML <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <ScanGroup ExportedOn= \"2021-11-05T11:18:57.673843\" > <Scan> </Scan> </ScanGroup> from urllib.parse import urlparse from faraday_plugins.plugins.plugin import PluginXMLFormat import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET class ExampleToolXmlParser : def __init__ ( self , xml_output ): self . vulns = self . parse_xml ( xml_output ) def parse_xml ( self , xml_output ): vulns = [] tree = ET . fromstring ( xml_output ) items = tree . iterfind ( 'details/item' ) for item in items : ip = item . get ( 'ip' ) os = item . get ( 'os' ) uri = item . find ( 'uri' ) . text url = urlparse ( uri ) hostname = [ url . netloc ] path = url . path if url . scheme == 'https' : port = 443 else : port = 80 issue = item . find ( 'issue' ) severity = issue . get ( 'severity' ) issue_text = issue . text vuln = { 'ip' : ip , 'uri' : uri , 'os' : os , 'hostname' : hostname , 'port' : port , 'path' : path , 'issue_text' : issue_text , 'severity' : severity } vulns . append ( vuln ) return vulns class ExampleToolPlugin ( PluginXMLFormat ): def __init__ ( self , ignore_info ): super () . __init__ ( ignore_info ) self . identifier_tag = \"example_tool\" self . id = \"example_tool\" self . name = \"Name of the tool\" self . plugin_version = \"0.0.1\" def parseOutputString ( self , output , debug = False ): parser = ExampleToolXmlParser ( output ) for vuln in parser . vulns : h_id = self . createAndAddHost ( vuln [ 'ip' ], vuln [ 'os' ], hostnames = vuln [ 'hostname' ]) s_id = self . createAndAddServiceToHost ( h_id , 'webserver' , protocol = 'tcp' , ports = vuln [ 'port' ]) v_id = self . createAndAddVulnWebToService ( h_id , s_id , vuln [ 'issue_text' ], severity = vuln [ 'severity' ], path = vuln [ 'path' ]) def createPlugin ( ignore_info = False , hostname_resolution = True ): return ExampleToolPlugin ( ignore_info = ignore_info ) PluginJsonFormat: \u00b6 Use this class if the plugin generates vulnerabilities from a json file. If yor report has json format but a different extension (not .json), remember to define the extension attribute To identify the file set in the json_keys attribute a set with some identifiers keys of the json object Example JSON { \"name\" : \"some name\" , \"hosts\" : [ \"host1\" , \"host2\" ], \"other_field\" : \"some value\" } class ExampleJsonTool ( PluginJsonFormat ): def __init__ ( self , ignore_info ): super () . __init__ ( ignore_info ) self . json_keys = { 'name' , 'hosts' } PluginMultiLineJsonFormat: \u00b6 Is the same as PluginJsonFormat but use it when the file has multiple lines and every line is a json. Example JSON { \"name\": \"some name\", \"hosts\": [\"host1\", \"host2\"],\"other_field\": \"some value\"} { \"name\": \"other name\", \"hosts\": [\"host3\", \"host4\"],\"other_field\": \"other value\"} class ExampleMultipleJsonTool ( PluginMultiLineJsonFormat ): def __init__ ( self , ignore_info ): super () . __init__ ( ignore_info ) self . json_keys = { 'name' , 'hosts' } PluginCSVFormat: \u00b6 Use this class if the plugin generates vulnerabilities from a csv file. If yor report has csv format but a different extension (not .csv), remember to define the extension attribute To identify the file set in the csv_headers attribute a set with some identifiers headers of the csv object Example CSV name,ip,os host1,10.10.10.10,windows host2,10.10.10.11,linux class ExampleCSVTool ( PluginCSVFormat ): def __init__ ( self , ignore_info ): super () . __init__ ( ignore_info ) self . json_keys = { 'name' , 'ip' } PluginZipFormat: \u00b6 Use this class if the plugin generates vulnerabilities from a zip file. If yor report has csv format but a different extension (not .zip), remember to define the extension attribute To identify the file set in the files_list attribute a set with some file names inside the zip file. class ExampleJsonTool ( PluginZipFormat ): def __init__ ( self , ignore_info ): super () . __init__ ( ignore_info ) self . files_list = { 'file1.txt' , 'file2.txt' } Generating data \u00b6 The PluginBase class give you all the main methods to create hosts, services and vulnerabilities After you parse the data you will need to create the objects with the information to send to faraday. This are the main methods def createAndAddHost ( self , name , os = \"unknown\" , hostnames = None , mac = None , scan_template = \"\" , site_name = \"\" , site_importance = \"\" , risk_score = \"\" , fingerprints = \"\" , fingerprints_software = \"\" ): def createAndAddServiceToHost ( self , host_id , name , protocol = \"tcp?\" , ports = None , status = \"open\" , version = \"unknown\" , description = \"\" ): def createAndAddVulnToHost ( self , host_id , name , desc = \"\" , ref = None , severity = \"\" , resolution = \"\" , vulnerable_since = \"\" , scan_id = \"\" , pci = \"\" , data = \"\" , external_id = None , run_date = None ): def createAndAddVulnToService ( self , host_id , service_id , name , desc = \"\" , ref = None , severity = \"\" , resolution = \"\" , risk = \"\" , data = \"\" , external_id = None , run_date = None ): def createAndAddVulnWebToService ( self , host_id , service_id , name , desc = \"\" , ref = None , severity = \"\" , resolution = \"\" , website = \"\" , path = \"\" , request = \"\" , response = \"\" , method = \"\" , pname = \"\" , params = \"\" , query = \"\" , category = \"\" , data = \"\" , external_id = None , run_date = None ): createAndAddHost and createAndAddServiceToHost will give you a host ID and a service ID. You need to send those to the create vulnerabilities methods The main method to parse data and create the vulnerabilities objects is parseOutputString , no mather if is a File or a Command plugin. Command Plugins \u00b6 For command plugins the detection is done via regex. If the plugin is only for command you inherit from PluginBase if it also will support file detection inherit from the appropriate class for that type of file. In both cases to detect a command you will need to set the _command_regex attribute with the regex to match the command Here's an example of the Ping tool plugin: class CmdPingPlugin ( PluginBase ): def __init__ ( self , * arg , ** kwargs ): super () . __init__ ( * arg , ** kwargs ) self . id = \"ping\" self . name = \"Ping\" self . plugin_version = \"0.0.1\" self . version = \"1.0.0\" self . _command_regex = re . compile ( r '^(sudo ping|ping|sudo ping6|ping6)\\s+.*?' ) def parseOutputString ( self , output ): reg = re . search ( r \"PING ([\\w\\.-:]+)( |)\\(([\\w\\.:]+)\\)\" , output ) if re . search ( \"0 received|unknown host\" , output ) is None and reg is not None : ip_address = reg . group ( 3 ) hostname = reg . group ( 1 ) self . createAndAddHost ( ip_address , hostnames = [ hostname ]) return True def _isIPV4 ( self , ip ): if len ( ip . split ( \".\" )) == 4 : return True else : return False In this case the plugin manager will run the command and send the output to the parseOutputString method. But if the tool generate an ouput file instead of send the data to stdout you will need to check that the command has the required parameters to do that. To do that you will need to implement the processCommandString method, by default it will return the command without modifications. To use output files you will need to set 2 attributes in you plugin: _use_temp_file and _temp_file_extension If _use_temp_file is set the plugin will create a temp file and assign its path to the attribute self._output_file_path of the plugin. If you need that the temp file has and specific extension use the _temp_file_extension attribute like in the example. If the _use_temp_file attribute is set the plugin will send te content of that file to parseOutputString() instead of the output of the command. Here is and extract of the nmap plugin to see how processCommandString will modify the original command and return a new command with the required parameters. class NmapPlugin ( PluginXMLFormat ): \"\"\" Example plugin to parse nmap output. \"\"\" def __init__ ( self , * arg , ** kwargs ): super () . __init__ ( * arg , ** kwargs ) self . identifier_tag = \"nmaprun\" self . id = \"Nmap\" self . name = \"Nmap XML Output Plugin\" self . plugin_version = \"0.0.3\" self . version = \"6.40\" self . framework_version = \"1.0.0\" self . options = None self . _current_output = None self . _command_regex = re . compile ( r '^(sudo nmap|nmap|\\.\\/nmap)\\s+.*?' ) self . _use_temp_file = True self . _temp_file_extension = \"xml\" self . xml_arg_re = re . compile ( r \"^.*(-oX\\s*[^\\s]+).*$\" ) self . addSetting ( \"Scan Technique\" , str , \"-sS\" ) def parseOutputString ( self , output ): ... def processCommandString ( self , username , current_path , command_string ): \"\"\" Adds the -oX parameter to get xml output to the command string that the user has set. \"\"\" super () . processCommandString ( username , current_path , command_string ) arg_match = self . xml_arg_re . match ( command_string ) if arg_match is None : return re . sub ( r \"(^.*?nmap)\" , r \"\\1 -oX %s \" % self . _output_file_path , command_string ) else : return re . sub ( arg_match . group ( 1 ), r \"-oX %s \" % self . _output_file_path , command_string ) Full Example \u00b6 File Plugin from XML This is an example of a Faraday Plugin that process a xml report.

This is for development \u00b6 Index \u00b6 Server Client Topics \u00b6 Faraday Server \u00b6 Faraday Server is the interface between PostgreSQL and Faraday Client and WebUI. The server's responsibility is to transmit information between the client or WebUI and PostgreSQL, and make sure that they are kept in sync. The Web UI client, which allows you to handle enormous workspaces from your favorite web browser. Important: You should keep in mind that is recommended to install Faraday server on the same instance as PostgreSQL. Downloading \u00b6 Clone the Faraday Git Project repository and checkout the dev branch: $ git clone https://github.com/infobyte/faraday.git faraday-dev $ cd faraday-dev $ pip install . After doing so, make sure to install system dependencies , install Python dependencies and configure the Server . Requirements \u00b6 Faraday Server is built with minimum requirements. This is by design, so you can install it even on the most bare-bones machine you can possibly imagine. The Python requirements for the server are stored in the requirements . Installing system dependencies \u00b6 Debian based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Backtrack, etc) \u00b6 Or if you wanna do it manually you can run the following command to install the required dependencies on any Debian based distribution. $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install build-essential ipython python3-setuptools \\ python3-pip python3-dev libssl-dev \\ libffi-dev pkg-config libxml2-dev \\ libxslt1-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev postgresql libpq-dev Warning : If you already have postgresql installed, please corroborate the version is upper than 9.4. Kali Linux \u00b6 If you are running Kali, please run the following commands: $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install build-essential ipython python-setuptools \\ python-pip python-dev libssl-dev \\ libffi-dev pkg-config libxml2-dev \\ libxslt1-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev Others \u00b6 Please consult with your distribution documentation to install the dependencies listed above. Creating a virtualenv \u00b6 Before installing Faraday, we need to create a virtualenv so Faraday runs in it. In order to install and create a virtualenv, run the following commands: $ pip install virtualenv $ virtualenv -p python3 faraday_venv $ source faraday_venv/bin/activate For more information about virtualenv, please follow this link . Installing Python 3 dependencies \u00b6 Once you have the required system dependencies, you just have to install the Python modules needed to run the server using: $ python setup.py develop Initializing PostgreSQL \u00b6 In order to initialize PostgreSQL database, run the following command: faraday-manage initdb IMPORTANT : The command initdb will create a random password for the admin user, remeber to COPY THE PASSWORD. You can use the command faraday-manage change-password if you want to change it. Note: You sould have the PostgreSQL service started. To do it run systemctl start postgresql or the equivalant command for your GNU/Linux distro. Note: if at the moment you run this command, it throws an error, be sure you have sudo installed. Once you have installed it, run the command again. Manual PostgreSQL configuration \u00b6 If you need an advance configuration of the postgres database, like having a custom database name or run it in a separate host, the faraday-manage initdb command probably won't be enough for you, so you should configure it manually by doing something like this: sudo -u postgres psql -c \"CREATE ROLE faraday_postgresql WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'YOURPASSWORD'\" sudo -u postgres createdb -O faraday_postgresql faraday Then, edit the ~/.faraday/config/server.ini by adding the connection string to the database: [database] connection_string = postgresql+psycopg2://faraday_postgresql:YOURPASSWORD@localhost/faraday Then you should run faraday-manage create-tables to create all the required tables to make faraday work, and faraday-manage createsuperuser to create an admin user. Manually importing from CouchDB \u00b6 If you were using Faraday 2.7.2 and setup the database manually instead of using the faraday-manage initdb , you should run the following command to import the data from CouchDB: $ python manage.py import-from-couchdb Updating Nginx configuration \u00b6 Note: This only applies if you are using Nginx and https. Please, make sure you have this settings on your Nginx config: 1 2 proxy_pass http :// localhost : 5985 /; proxy_redirect http :// $ scheme ://; Configuration \u00b6 By default, Faraday server will listen on port 5985 . You can edit this on ~/.faraday/config/server.ini . Exposing the Server \u00b6 If you wish to access the Server form a different box you need to expose the service. In order to do so, edit the server configuration file and set the bind_address param to 0.0.0.0 . Edit the file located in ~/.faraday/config/server.ini and under the section [faraday-server] set the param, it should look something like this: [faraday-server] ... bind_address=0.0.0.0 Then restart the server if you had it running and reload your browser in case you were already trying to access the Web UI form a different IP. faraday-server also allow to use --bind and --port to override server.ini settings. Running \u00b6 Once everything is installed and the server is configured, you can proceed to run the Faraday server script: $ faraday-server If you want to run the server in background mode, you should use the --start option: $ faraday-server --start This is the recommended way to do this. Other methods like using the bash & could cause unexpected IOErrors and other related exceptions. Web UI \u00b6 Once the server is running, you can access Faraday's Web UI using any browser: just point it to http://SERVER_IP:SERVER_PORT/ (by default it will be http://localhost:5985/ ) and you can start playing with Faraday. Faraday Client \u00b6 Faraday Client is the software which will allow you to work with your favorite security tools and capture their output in an organized manner. It works under a GTK+3 interface with the popular VTE terminal with a custom ZSH shell that respects the user's configuration (yes, that means you get to keep your exact ZSH terminal inside Faraday, even if you use ZPrezto or Oh My ZSH). From the client you can also create and delete workspaces, specify plugin configuration, view information about your hosts, resolve conflics that may arise and much more. It's also a responsibility of the client to send all of the collected information to the server, which will then process it and format it in an friendly way for you to view, edit, and confirm. The client is bundled in the same package as the server, so if you have already downloaded Faraday, you can skip the next step. Downloading \u00b6 Download the latest tarball or clone the Faraday Git Project repository and checkout dev branch: 1 2 3 $ git clone https://github.com/infobyte/faraday.git faraday-dev $ git checkout dev $ cd faraday-dev Requirements \u00b6 Faraday Client works under any modern Linux distribution or Mac OS X, and needs Python 3.6+. The Python requirements for the client are stored in the requirements.txt file . Some additional requirements are necessary for specific features to work, these are stored in the requirements_extras.txt file . Out tests include Debian , Ubuntu , Kali , Backtrack . Installing system dependencies \u00b6 Debian and derivatives \u00b6 You can run the following command to install the required dependencies on any Debian based distribution. $ sudo apt update If you are running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, or Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, please execute this command: $ sudo apt install libpq-dev python-pip python-dev gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-vte-2.90 python-gobject zsh curl If you are any other version, please execute the following command: $ sudo apt install libpq-dev python-pip python-dev gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-vte-2.91 python-gobject zsh curl Gentoo \u00b6 This are the dependencies for Gentoo with Emerge: dev-libs/gobject-introspection net-libs/webkit-gtk x11-libs/gtk+ \\ x11-libs/vte dev-python/pygobject app-shells/zsh net-misc/curl dev-python/ipython Extras dependencies: dev-python/beautifulsoup dev-python/gevent-psycopg2 Using GTK client with virtualenv \u00b6 If you are working inside a Virtual enviroment you need to follow this extra steps for GTK to work: pip install vext pip install vext.pygtk pip install vext.gi Configuration \u00b6 Now you need to configure every Faraday instance so it can connect to the server. If you're using the GTK interface click on the Preferences icon and fill in the server URL, for example http://127.0.0.1:5985 If you are using the --gui=no-gui option Edit the file: ~/.faraday/config/user.xml And search for the following api_uri tag and set it to the server URL, for example: <api_uri>http://127.0.0.1:5985</api_uri> If you are using SSL you need to use https in your configuration. For example use https://192.168.0.20 when you are using an nginx server with SSL enabled and faraday-server is listening on 192.168.0.20. Running \u00b6 Once you have already configured the client and have Faraday Server running, you simply have to run: $ faraday-client Some distributions or installations require additional steps, so look down below if you are using something different than Debian or Ubuntu, or if you need to apply some configuration to the client. Kali \u00b6 Faraday comes pre-installed in Kali Rolling. The package name is python-faraday . Keep in mind that this package can only be used for the Community edition . In order to run Faraday in Kali: $ systemctl start postgresql.service $ cd /usr/share/python-faraday $ faraday-server $ faraday-client Due to Kali's package updates the pre-installed package may not be the last version. If you want the latest updates use the Debian install steps . Gentoo \u00b6 If you are running Gentoo, this are the dependencies with Emerge: dev-python/flask-sqlalchemy dev-python/service_identity dev-python/twisted \\ dev-python/pyopenssl dev-java/mockito dev-python/Whoosh \\ dev-python/configargparse dev-python/restkit dev-python/requests www-servers/tornado \\ dev-python/flask dev-python/colorama dev-python/setuptools dev-python/pip dev-libs/libpqxx \\ libffi-dev","title":"Development setup"},{"location":"Development-setup/#to-use-faraday-follow-the-new-faraday-install-guide-this-is-for-development","text":"","title":"To use faraday follow the new Faraday Install Guide.

Contact us Topics \u00b6 Where does the name come from? \u00b6 The name was picked to honor Michael Faraday , an English scientist whose main discoveries include electromagnetism induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis. Mainly his six principles of scientific discipline, acquired at a young age from Isaac Watts' \"The Improvement of the mind\": * Always carry a small pad to take notes at any time * Maintain abundant correspondence * Collaborate regularly with others to exchange ideas * Avoid controversy * Verify everything that was said to him * Do not generalize, speak and write as precisely as possible Read more at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~sjreeves/cm/improve.html What is Faraday? \u00b6 Faraday is a multiuser integrated penetration test and vulnerability management environment . It is to Penetration Testing what an IDE is to Development. The main purpose of Faraday is to re-use the available tools in the community to take advantage of them in a multiuser way. Is Faraday free? \u00b6 Yes, we have a Community version which is totally free, you can download it from Github We also have two Commercial versions, details about those in our webpage . Compare different versions of Faraday Does Faraday have collaboration tools? \u00b6 Faraday supports over 80 tools. Full plugin list available here . Which platforms are supported? \u00b6 RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Kali, Ubuntu, Docker. Does Faraday work on my servers or on the cloud? \u00b6 Yes it does, depending on your needs. For more information you can contact us at sales@infobytesec.com What are the system requirements to run Faraday? \u00b6 CPU: 2 Dualcore 2GHz Intel CPU Disk: 40 GB Memory: 4 GB RAM (8 GB RAM recommended) Current tests include Debian, Ubuntu, Kali, and Backtrack. If instead of installing you want to take a quick look at Faraday you can also use Docker . I purchased a License, now what? \u00b6 You will receive an email with a link to download everything regarding your license. If you haven\u2019t received it or are having issues, please contact us at sales@infobytesec.com . Can I keep using the Kali version with my newly bought Professional/Corporate license? \u00b6 In a nutshell, yes. Even though the Kali Faraday version is incompatible with both the Professional and Corporate licenses, you can upgrade the platform in the same box without losing all your data. You will need to remove the package python-faraday and then you need to install the pro/corp .deb with apt install ./faraday-server_amd64.deb Can I install the Server and/or Client in my own box instead of using a Virtual Machine you provided? \u00b6 The only intended purpose for the Faraday VM is as a commercial demo. For production environments we recommend doing a fresh install in a Ubuntu Server, please do not use your provided Demo License VM. If the use of a Virtualized environment is a must-have, then we recommend doing a proper install in a fresh Virtual Machine following the regular installation steps. How do I know which Faraday Version I'm using? \u00b6 By running faraday-server --version or hovering your mouse over the Faraday logo at the top left of the Web UI. Latest version and information available in the Upgrading Faraday section. To get the latest available version: for the community version, visit Github for the commercial versions, check the Customer Portal What if I want to add a Vulnerability manually? \u00b6 You can do this using our Web UI, read our documentation on manually adding vulnerabilities . How do I bind Faraday to 0.0.0.0? \u00b6 Just go to /home/faraday/.faraday/config/server.ini and inside the [faraday-server] section write: bind_address=0.0.0.0 Restart Faraday Server if you had it running. That's it! Where are my credentials? \u00b6 When installing Faraday you run the following command: faraday-manage initdb and get your credentials on the terminal (something like this): username: faraday password: a7e8d3seWqy5 If you don't remember this, below, you can see how to re-generate them. I lost my credentials \u00b6 If during the instalation you forget to store or keep your credentials, don't worry, you can either create a new admin user or change the default admin user: Change faraday default admin user (enter the new password): $ faraday-manage change-password Username: faraday Password: Repeat for confirmation: Password changed succesfully Create a new admin user (Only for paid users): $ faraday-manage create-superuser Username: admin Email: admin@example.com Password: Repeat for confirmation: User admin created successfully!

You break it. We keep track of the pieces! To maximize flexibility Faraday Plugins run only on the client, which means you can have custom, private plugins all for yourself! There are three kinds of plugins available for Faraday; console , report and API also called online . However, these are not mutually exclusive, meaning that some tools have more than one Plugin to process their output. For example, Nmap has a Console plugin which allows you to run it directly from ZSH, but it also has a Report one, in order to import scans that were run outside of Faraday. Console \u00b6 Check Faraday-Cli to use this feature! Plugins that intercept commands, fired directly when a command is detected in the console. These are transparent to you and no additional action on your part is needed. Report \u00b6 Use the web UI to import reports. Check this Article !

Traceback Troubleshooting \u00b6 For traceback troubleshooting you need to open the Faraday logs and search for the string ERROR . Logs are located on /home/faraday/.faraday/logs . In this section we will show common errors and possible solutions. We recommend to search part of the error in this page and try to match the error with possible solutions.

Try running: $ faraday-manage status-check That will give some information about the state Faraday is in at the moment. If the Server is not running try: $ faraday-server Faraday is not importing my report \u00b6 First let's make sure there is a Plugin to parse it so make sure your tool is listed in our Plugin List . Not there? Code your own or ask us to do it Community , Pro and Corp users You can also try to force Faraday to process a report with a certain plugin. For example, let's say you have a Metasploit report that Faraday is not detecting. You can change the report so that it ends with _faraday_Metasploit (first letter of the plugin in uppercase), so it ends up as myreport_faraday_Metasploit.xml , and then copy it to /home/faraday/.faraday/reports/{workspacename} in the Client. This of course works for any plugin, not only Metasploit. Keep in mind that Plugins don't run on the Server, so if you're trying to copy the report file, make sure you're doint it on the Client . A plugin added too much information to my database \u00b6 You can go to your Activity Feed in the Web GUI, filter the vulnerabilities by whichever parameter you'd like, select them all and then click on Delete to remove them form the database.

Custom Attributes type can be int , str or list . You can learn more about Custom Attributes creation on this wiki page . In this small tutorial, we are going to use Python's library Requests and Faraday's API to authenticate, create a vulnerability and modify its Custom Attributes. Step 1: Authentication \u00b6 To authenticate in Faraday, we are going to use a function called faraday_authentication(). This function will return an authenticated request session. def faraday_authentication ( host , username , password ): \"\"\" @host: Faraday server host, e.g: http://127.0.0.1:5985 @username: Faraday username @password: username's password Return requests session object \"\"\" session = requests . Session () headers = { 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' , # Very important! send this content-type header!! } data = '{\"email\":username,\"password\": password}' response = s . post ( ' {0} /_api/login' . format ( host ), headers = headers , data = data ) assert response . status_code == 200 return session Step 2: Create Custom Attributes \u00b6 In order to create a new Custom Attribute, follow the steps specified in this wiki page . Step 3: Create a vulnerability from the API \u00b6 Before using the API, you need to understand how to send the data to the server. Faraday Server accepts JSON. Assuming that you created a custom attribute with the following data: Field name: cvss , Display name: CVSS and assuming that this vulnerability has as CVSS, the score \"4\", the JSON format for creating this vulnerability is the following: { \"metadata\": { \"update_time\": 1549569790.632, \"update_user\": \"\", \"update_action\": 0, \"creator\": \"UI Web\", \"create_time\": 1549569790.632, \"update_controller_action\": \"UI Web New\", \"owner\": \"faraday\" }, \"obj_id\": \"\", \"owner\": \"faraday\", \"parent\": 24, \"parent_type\": \"Host\", \"type\": \"Vulnerability\", \"ws\": \"demo_workspace\", \"confirmed\": true, \"data\": \"\", \"desc\": \"Test\", \"easeofresolution\": null, \"impact\": { \"accountability\": false, \"availability\": false, \"confidentiality\": false, \"integrity\": false }, \"name\": \"dsadsadsa\", \"owned\": false, \"policyviolations\": [], \"refs\": [], \"resolution\": \"\", \"severity\": \"unclassified\", \"issuetracker\": \"\", \"status\": \"opened\", \"custom_fields\": { \"CVSS\" : \"4\" }, \"_attachments\": {}, \"description\": \"\", \"protocol\": \"\", \"version\": \"\" } Important * Note that we have a key called \"custom_fields\" (which contains our custom attributes) with its display name and its value: \"custom_fields\": { \"CVSS\" : \"4\" } Two important fields that we need to understand are parent_id and parent_type . In the JSON above, we specified them as follow: \"parent_type\" : \"Host\" \"parent_id\" : \"24\" This mean that in our database we have a Host with id 24 .

Developers have to deal with languages they don't know, undocumented APIs or new paradigms. This leads to the fact that many product teams decide not to open the possibility to integrate to them. In Faraday\u2019s case, we are aware that integrations with other security tools are a critical part of our product. However, we\u2019ve realized that our existing Plugin system wasn\u2019t as easy as we expected to develop some integrations: it required some level of interactivity (either running a command from the console or importing a report), so it was hard to use on a periodic basis. It also forced integration developers to use our Python API, even when the tool to integrate with wasn\u2019t programmed in Python, making it harder for the developer. To solve this problem, we decided to implement the Agents feature in the already released Faraday v3.9. Since we expect this to be a core feature of our product, it will be available both in Community and commercial versions!. Architecture \u00b6 Overview of the Agents Feature \u00b6 An Agent represents a process running continuously in a machine (not necessary the same running the Faraday Server). When a user decides to run an Agent (typically done through the Faraday Web UI), it will execute a code and send data back to a Workspace. In the image above, you can see a workspace with many custom agents. They're in charge of finding hosts in the network with nmap, finding subdomains with sublist3r, and provision data from our Heroku-hosted services. In addition to running the agents manually with their \"Run\" button, you can also schedule them to run periodically. This can be done from the web if you have our Corporate version: Now you can Run an Agent for a single use! or with simple cronjobs if you are using the Community or Paid version. Agents technical details \u00b6 To make integrations with Faraday as easy as possible, we developed a project we called Faraday Agent Dispatcher that is in charge of handling the communication between the Faraday Server and your own agents. The only thing you\u2019ll need to build your own integrations is a script (we call it an Executor) that prints to standard output all the data you want to send to Faraday (hosts info, vulnerabilities, etc.) encoded in JSON. There is no need to use complex APIs or communication methods, as all of this is abstracted by the Dispatcher. You just need to print JSON to standard out, and the Dispatcher will handle the rest! If you want to know a little bit about the idea behind build this project, one of our developers explain a little about it. This also means that you could use virtually any programming language you want to build your integrations, as long as they support printing data to standard output. We've already made agents in Python, Bash, and even a Brainfuckone! We have some official executors, which are ready to go with minimum configuration. If you want to develop and run your own executor, you can configure a custom one! How to start using agents \u00b6 Lets try with an example with Nmap to check the Faraday Agents capabilities both as a custom executor, and run an official one. First of all you must install the Faraday Dispatcher inside the server you want to run the Agent on. You can do so running one of the following commands: $ git clone https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_agent_dispatcher $ git clone https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_agent_parameter__types $ pip3 install faraday_agent_dispatcher After this, you can setup the agent through the Web UI by clicking the tab Create Agent , a windows like this will be displayed Once you choose your desired configuration, you'll be able to select the tools that need to be run After selecting the tools, you'll be able to download the dispatcher.yaml Please follow the instruccions depending on what you are working with, in this case we are using Python, so in order to make this work the dispatcher.yaml must be placed in the following folder $HOME /.faraday/config Now you would be able to run the agent in your server If you have done this correctly, the new agent will be displayed in the Agent view Or you can just do it in the manual way running the configuration wizard: $ faraday-dispatcher config-wizard Do you want to edit the [ A ] gent or the [ E ] xecutors?

Also, we recommend you to check our examples and official executors to get an idea of what a custom integration looks like. What's Next \u00b6 We will continue to improve Agents\u2019 features, usability, and adding new executors into the Dispatcher repository. In the next few releases we would also like to give some Agents read access to their Workspace, so they can benefit from the existing data in order to find more valuable information.

Developers have to deal with languages they don't know, undocumented APIs or new paradigms. This leads to the fact that many product teams decide not to open the possibility to integrate to them. In Faraday\u2019s case, we are aware that integrations with other security tools are a critical part of our product. However, we\u2019ve realized that our existing Plugin system wasn\u2019t as easy as we expected to develop some integrations: it required some level of interactivity (either running a command from the console or importing a report), so it was hard to use on a periodic basis. It also forced integration developers to use our Python API, even when the tool to integrate with wasn\u2019t programmed in Python, making it harder for the developer. To solve this problem, we decided to implement the Agents feature in the already released Faraday v3.9. Since we expect this to be a core feature of our product, it will be available both in Community and commercial versions!. Architecture \u00b6 Overview of the Agents Feature \u00b6 An Agent represents a process running continuously in a machine (not necessary the same running the Faraday Server). When a user decides to run an Agent (typically done through the Faraday Web UI), it will execute a code and send data back to a Workspace. In the image above, you can see a workspace with many custom agents. They're in charge of finding hosts in the network with nmap, finding subdomains with sublist3r, and provision data from our Heroku-hosted services. In addition to running the agents manually with their \"Run\" button, you can also schedule them to run periodically. This can be done from the web if you have our Corporate version: Now you can Run an Agent for a single use! or with simple cronjobs if you are using the Community or Paid version. Agents technical details \u00b6 To make integrations with Faraday as easy as possible, we developed a project we called Faraday Agent Dispatcher that is in charge of handling the communication between the Faraday Server and your own agents. The only thing you\u2019ll need to build your own integrations is a script (we call it an Executor) that prints to standard output all the data you want to send to Faraday (hosts info, vulnerabilities, etc.) encoded in JSON. There is no need to use complex APIs or communication methods, as all of this is abstracted by the Dispatcher. You just need to print JSON to standard out, and the Dispatcher will handle the rest! If you want to know a little bit about the idea behind build this project, one of our developers explain a little about it. This also means that you could use virtually any programming language you want to build your integrations, as long as they support printing data to standard output. We've already made agents in Python, Bash, and even a Brainfuckone! We have some official executors, which are ready to go with minimum configuration. If you want to develop and run your own executor, you can configure a custom one! How to start using agents \u00b6 Lets try with an example with Nmap to check the Faraday Agents\u2019 capabilities both as a custom executor, and run an official one. First of all you have to get your Agent\u2019s token. On your Web UI go to Settings > Agents. Your token is: ImalA8Cg1L6Z5Qbx2u9CFAsob Now you must install the Faraday Dispatcher inside the server you want to run the Agent on. You can do so running one of the following commands: $ git clone https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_agent_dispatcher $ git clone https://github.com/infobyte/faraday_agent_parameter__types $ pip3 install faraday_agent_dispatcher After this, you need to run the configuration wizard: $ faraday-dispatcher config-wizard Do you want to edit the [ A ] gent or the [ E ] xecutors?
